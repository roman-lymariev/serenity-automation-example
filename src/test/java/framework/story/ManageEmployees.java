 * The JBehave framework are run via a JUnit runner. This makes it easier to run the framework both from within an IDE or as part of the build process.
 * All you need to do is to extend the SerenityStories class.
 *
 * When you run this test, Serenity will run any JBehave framework.story that it finds in the default directory location. By convention, it will look for
 * a framework.story folder on your classpath, so "src/test/resources/framework.story" is a good place to put your framework.story files.
